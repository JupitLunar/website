# Feeding Roadmap (Birth–12 Months)

> **Disclaimer**: Educational resource only. It does *not* replace personalized medical advice. Infants with prematurity, medical conditions, or strong allergy history should be managed with their pediatrician.

## 0–5 Months: Foundation
- **Primary nutrition**: on-demand breast milk or iron-fortified formula. Expect ~8–12 feeds per 24 hours.
- **Readiness cues**: steady head control, minimal tongue-thrust reflex, ability to sit with support, interest in food.
- **Doctor visits**: keep scheduled well-child checks; monitor growth curve and vitamin D supplementation (400 IU/day for breastfed babies).

## 6 Months: First Solids
| Week | Focus | Actions |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Week 1 | Iron-rich single ingredients | Iron-fortified cereal, meat purée, bean purée. Offer 1–2 teaspoons once daily; wait 2–3 days before a new food. |
| Week 2 | Add vegetable/fruit purées | Smooth textures of sweet potato, squash, pear. No added salt or sugar. |
| Week 3 | Thicker textures | Transition to thicker purées, maintaining milk feeds. |
| Week 4 | Sensory learning | Introduce a second meal, still tiny portions, following baby’s cues. |

## 7–8 Months: Build Routines
- **Meals**: 2–3 solid meals + ~6 milk feeds.
- **Composition**: combine iron source + vitamin C + healthy fat.
- **Finger foods**: soft, adult finger-length pieces (steamed veggies, banana, toast strips). Texture must squish between fingers.
- **Allergen introduction**: start with peanut or egg in safe textures, one at a time. Offer pea-sized portions at home on healthy days; observe 2–3 hours. Maintain tolerance with 2–3 servings per week once tolerated.

## 9–10 Months: Expand & Explore
- **Meals**: 3 meals + 1–2 snacks.
- **Texture**: minced/finely chopped; encourage self-feeding with spoons.
- **Protein diversity**: poultry, fish, tofu, yogurt (unsweetened, full-fat).
- **Hydration**: open cup training with small water servings (2–4 oz/day). Keep juice off the table.

## 11–12 Months: Transition to Family Meals
- **Meal pattern**: 3 balanced meals + 2 snacks, mirroring family schedule.
- **Milk**: breast milk/formula continues; transition to whole cow’s milk after the first birthday if pediatrician agrees (16–24 oz/day).
- **Family foods**: share soft, low-sodium, low-sugar dishes. Avoid choking hazards.
- **Self-feeding**: practice with fork/spoon; model safe eating pace.

## Safety & Monitoring Checklist
1. **Choking prevention**: sit upright, stay close, cut foods lengthwise. Avoid round/hard items.
2. **Allergic reactions**: hives, swelling, vomiting, wheeze—severe signs require emergency services.
3. **Hydration/stool watch**: monitor diaper output; persistent diarrhea/constipation needs clinician input.
4. **Illness**: pause new foods during illness; reintroduce once stable.
5. **Supplements**: vitamin D (400 IU/day for breastfed/partially breastfed infants); iron per pediatrician.

## Maintenance & Review
- **Update cadence**: review feeding plan every 60–90 days as guidelines evolve.
- **Logbook**: track new foods, reactions, and favorite combos via Mom AI Agent tools.
