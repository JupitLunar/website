## 📝 Next Steps

### Option 1: Add These Foods to Database
These 15 new foods need to be added to the `kb_foods` table before their images can be used. You'll need to create database entries with:
- Basic info (name, slug, locale)
- Age ranges
- Preparation guidelines
- Nutritional information
- Safety information

### Option 2: Generate More Images
Continue generating images for the remaining priority foods:
- Pear, Peach, Plum, Papaya
- Watermelon, Cantaloupe, Kiwi, Orange
- Green beans, Cauliflower, Zucchini, Spinach
- Turkey, Pork, Tofu, Beans
- Quinoa, Barley, Crackers, Cereal

### Option 3: Optimize Current Images
Convert all 24 PNG images to WebP format for better performance:
- Expected size reduction: 60-80%
- Better loading times
- Same visual quality
